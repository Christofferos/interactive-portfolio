          <p>
            I am a curious and happy person, who enjoys taking on challenging tasks. If
            given the oppertunity to lead a group of people, I am more than happy to take
            such a role. My 9 years of experience in leadership within e-sport has given
            me a greater understanding of team dynamics and the importance of
            communication. Creating esthetic websites together with smart purposeful
            applications, is what I love doing.

          <h6>Full Stack Developer</h6>
          <p>
            Most businesses in my local area, Drevviksstrand, do not have websites that
            make their brand more accessible for possible customers. That's why I started
            reaching out to several of them in order to gain valuable experience in the
            freelancing enviorment.

          <p>
            From my 9 years of playing the e-sport game League of Legends, I learned a
            thing or two. I achieved the highest rank in both of the competitive game
            modes and later moved on to competitive online tournaments for one year. Then
            I found the website Gamer Sensei, where users could pay you money to be
            coached - it felt like the perfect next step.

          <p>
            During my year of working at McDonalds Farsta Centrum, I learned to work well
            under presure, the importance of distrubuting work load within a team and
            prioritizing tasks when time is of the essence! I also, realized that it was
            possible to have a great time with colleagues, even though we were faced by an
            assembly line of new customers all the time.
